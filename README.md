# YAMPA

YAMPA is Yet Another Meshcore Packet Analyser.

![YAMPA packet analyzer](screenshots/main.png)

This repository contains:

- A React frontend UI.
- A Python WebSocket server implementation in `server-pymc_core/`.

The frontend expects a WebSocket endpoint that streams packet events as JSON
or a WebSocket stream from a MQTT server.

## Server (WebSocket packet stream)

Both server implementations serve the same WebSocket endpoint. **The server and frontend do not need to run on the same machine.**

- **URL:** `ws://<host>:<port>/ws`
- **Default:** `ws://localhost:8080/ws`

### Option A: pyMC_Core Server (`server.py`)

For Linux hosts with a supported LoRa radio directly attached (Waveshare, uConsole, etc.) or a KISS TNC. Decodes packets server-side.

```bash
python3 server-pymc_core/server.py --radio-type uconsole --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
python3 server-pymc_core/server.py --radio-type kiss-tnc --serial-port /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Option B: MeshCore Companion Bridge (`server_companion.py`)

For devices flashed with **MeshCore USB Serial Companion** firmware (e.g. Heltec ESP32+SX1262). Receives raw packets over USB serial via the `meshcore` Python library and forwards them to the frontend, which decodes them client-side.

1. Flash your device with MeshCore USB Serial Companion firmware from [flasher.meshcore.co.uk](https://flasher.meshcore.co.uk)
2. Configure the correct frequency and radio settings for your region via the [MeshCore web app](https://meshcore.co.uk) before running the bridge.
3. Install the meshcore library in the project venv:
   ```bash
   pip install meshcore
   ```
4. Run the bridge:
   ```bash
   python3 server-pymc_core/server_companion.py --serial-port /dev/tty.usbserial-0001
   ```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `--serial-port` | `/dev/ttyUSB0` | Serial port for the companion device |
| `--host` | `localhost` | WebSocket server bind address |
| `--port` | `8080` | WebSocket server port |

## MQTT Server

Connecting to a MQTT server requires that a number of variables be defined
to specify the server and credentials to connect with. The MQTT connection
is enabled when MQTT_URL is specified otherwise the websocket packet stream
is used. The topic to subscribe to is also specified with an environmental
variable but it will default to `meshcore/+/+/packets` if not specified.

```shell
MQTT_URL=ws://broker:8083/mqtt
MQTT_USERNAME=user
MQTT_PASSWORD=pass
MQTT_TOPIC=meshcore/+/+/packets       # default value
```

It should be noted that if the protocol used to access the YAMPA application
uses TLS, then the connection to the MQTT server needs to also use TLS.
This is a requirement enforced by TypeScript. If you attempt to mix TLS
connections with non-TLS connections, then the MQTT connection will be
denied by TypeScript and the MQTT connection will never succeed. If you
are having troubles with the MQTT connection check the JavaScript console
for error messages.

The topic is set to receive packets sent with `meshcoretomqtt` script.
`meshcoretomqtt` can be found at https://github.com/Cisien/meshcoretomqtt.
Using the default topic pattern will allow packets to be read from all
regions and all observers. If you desire to restrict what YAMPA can read,
the first `+` represents the region code and the second `+` is the public
key of each observer that is logging to the MQTT server.

## Frontend

### Run locally

**Prerequisites:** Node.js

1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`

## Connecting the frontend to a remote server

By default, the frontend connects to `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.

If the server runs on a different machine (for example, the server on a Raspberry Pi and the frontend on your laptop), you must proxy the WebSocket endpoint so the browser can reach it.

### Option A: SSH tunnel (quick dev setup)

Forward your local port `8080` to the remote server’s `8080`:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8080:localhost:8080 pi@<server-host>
```

Then keep the frontend pointing at `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.

### Option B: Nginx reverse proxy (recommended)

Terminate HTTP(S) at Nginx and proxy the WebSocket upgrade to the server. Example:

```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  server_name yampa.example.com;

  location /ws {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080/ws;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
  }
}
```

From the browser you would then connect to `ws://yampa.example.com/ws` (or `wss://...` if served over TLS).
